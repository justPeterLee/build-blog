### Earphones have come a long way. It's about time we forget about the headphone jack.

I have to admit that I was a bit late to join the bluetooth headphones party. I got my WH-1000XM3s only last year. It was my first pair of bluetooth headphones. About after a week with the WH-1000XM3s, I stopped carrying wired earpods. Noise cancelling was great for morning commutes in London. Battery life was so good that I never had to care about it. Returning back to wired headphones was not an option for me anymore.

However, the WH-1000XM3s are huge and can't be carried around easily. This made me want in-ear noise cancelling alternatives. Around the same time I started my search, Apple launched AirPods Pro. The reviews were all good so I decided to give it a try.

In this blog post, I will be talking about my overall experience with Apple's AirPods Pro. The following list is ordered by importance to me.
